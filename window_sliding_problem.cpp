/*
This technique shows how a nested for loop in few problems can be converted to single for loop and hence reducing the time complexity.

Letâ€™s start with a problem for illustration where we can apply this technique:


Given an array of integers of size 'n'.Our aim is to calculate the maximum sum of 'k' consecutive elements in the array.

Input  : arr[] = {100, 200, 300, 400}
         k = 2
Output : 700

Input  : arr[] = {1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20}
         k = 4
Output : 39
We get maximum sum by adding subarray {4, 2, 10, 23}
of size 4.

Input  : arr[] = {2, 3}
         k = 3
Output : Invalid
There is no subarray of size 3 as size of whole
array is 2.

Naive approach:

The Naive Approach to solve this problem is to calculate sum for each of the blocks of K consecutive elements and compare which block has the maximum sum possible. The time complexity of this approach will be O(n * k).



Window Sliding Technique:


The above problem can be solved in Linear Time Complexity by using Window Sliding Technique by avoiding the overhead of calculating sum repeatedly for each block of k elements.

The technique can be best understood with the window pane in bus, consider a window of length n and the pane which is fixed in it of length k. Consider, initially the pane is at extreme left i.e., at 0 units from the left. Now, co-relate the window with array arr[] of size n and plane with current_sum of size k elements. Now, if we apply force on the window such that it moves a unit distance ahead. The pane will cover next k consecutive elements.

Consider an array arr[] = {5 , 2 , -1 , 0 , 3} and value of k = 3 and n = 5

Applying sliding window technique :


We compute the sum of first k elements out of n terms using a linear loop and store the sum in variable window_sum.
Then we will graze linearly over the array till it reaches the end and simultaneously keep track of maximum sum.
To get the current sum of block of k elements just subtract the first element from the previous block and add the last element of the current block .
